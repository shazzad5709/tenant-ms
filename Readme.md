# Tenant Management System (TMS)

The Tenant Management System (TMS) is a web-based application intended to overcome inefficiencies in traditional tenant management procedures, which are sometimes time-consuming and unproductive. The projectâ€™s goal is to design an online application that simplifies tenant management responsibilities while providing a seamless experience for both homeowners and tenants. TMS aims to streamline the operations of monitoring tenant information. It also manages maintenance requests in order to save time and reduce manual work.
